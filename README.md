# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

# Project Title

A brief description of your React.js project.

## Instructions to Run Locally

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git clonehttps://github.com/hafsatyusuf14/profile-pal.git

```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory.

Navigate to the directory of the cloned project by running the following command:

```bash
    cd profile-pal
```

### 3. Install dependencies locally.

Before running the application, you need to install its dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
    npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Once all dependencies are installed, start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
   npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### 5. Explore the Application

You can now explore the application in your web browser. Make sure to check out all the features and functionalities.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
